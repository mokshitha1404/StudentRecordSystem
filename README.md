Student Record Management System
Objective
To design and implement a mini system in C++ that demonstrates file handling,
data processing, sorting, and basic performance monitoring.
Description
This project reads student records from a CSV file, processes the data by
sorting it based on student ID, and writes the processed records into a new
CSV file. Basic performance metrics such as number of records processed and
execution time are also displayed.
Due to time constraints, network transmission was simulated via file-based
data transfer. The design can be extended to support WebSocket communication.
Input File
students.csv  
Format:
id,name,age,grade
Output File
received_students.csv  
Contains sorted student records.
